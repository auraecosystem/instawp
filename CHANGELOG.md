# Changelog

## 0.0.1-beta.16 (2026-06-02)

### Changed — renamed `snapshot` → `versions`
- The command added in beta.15 is now **`instawp versions create|list|restore|delete`** (alias `version`). Renamed from `snapshot` to avoid confusion with InstaWP's separate **Snapshots** product — these are a site's restorable **versions**. Same flags and behavior; only the command name changed.

## 0.0.1-beta.15 (2026-06-01)

### Added — `snapshot` command (restorable site versions)
- New `instawp snapshot create|list|restore|delete` (alias `snapshots`) for managing **site snapshots** — InstaWP's restorable "site versions", point-in-time copies of a site's files + database. Unlike backups, a snapshot can be rolled back to **in-place**.
- Built for the AI-agent workflow: take a snapshot *before* letting an agent run a batch of changes, then roll back the one that broke it in a single command.
  - `snapshot create <site> [--name <label>] [--no-wait]` — waits for the snapshot to finish by default; `--no-wait` returns as soon as it's queued.
  - `snapshot list <site>` — ID, name, size, status, and creation date.
  - `snapshot restore <site> <version-id> [--force] [--no-wait]` — **overwrites** the live site's files + database; prompts for confirmation unless `--force`.
  - `snapshot delete <site> <version-id...> [--force]`.
- All subcommands support `--json`. Long-running create/restore poll task status with a progress spinner.

## 0.0.1-beta.14 (2026-05-28)

### Improved — clearer first-run for `local` commands
- When `local create/start/clone` falls back to `npx` (no global `wp-playground-cli`), the CLI now prints a one-time dim hint explaining the first-run download (~30s) and how to skip it on future runs (`npm i -g @wp-playground/cli`). Previously users just saw npm's raw download output with no context. Shown once per run, on stderr, and suppressed in `--json` mode.

## 0.0.1-beta.13 (2026-05-28)

### Fixed — `wp` / `exec` site resolution (issue #3)
- `instawp wp <site>` / `instawp exec <site>` could fail to resolve a site by name with "No site found" (or, on older builds, hang at "Resolving site…") on accounts where the `/sites` list didn't return the site in a single `per_page=100` page.
- **Fix**: `resolveSite` now paginates the `/sites` endpoint (`per_page=20`, walking `meta.last_page`) instead of relying on one large page. This is robust for accounts with 100+ sites and resilient to environments where the API returns fewer rows than requested for large `per_page` values. Matches how `sites list` paginates.

## 0.0.1-beta.12 (2026-05-26)

### Fixed — `local create/start/clone` on Windows (`spawn npx ENOENT`)
- WordPress Playground launch failed on Windows with `spawn npx ENOENT`. On Windows `npx`/`wp-playground-cli` are `.cmd` shims, and Node refuses to spawn `.cmd` without `shell: true` (since the CVE-2024-27980 fix) — so the bare `spawn('npx', …)` failed.
- **Fix**: route the Playground spawns through `cross-spawn`, which resolves `.cmd` shims and quotes arguments (e.g. `--mount` paths with spaces) safely. macOS/Linux behavior is unchanged.

## 0.0.1-beta.11 (2026-05-26)

### Improved — parallel SFTP transfers on Windows
- Windows file sync now transfers files across a **pool of parallel SSH connections** instead of one-at-a-time. Measured ~2.9× speedup (a 238-file wp-content pull dropped from ~369s to ~129s).
- Concurrency defaults to 4, configurable via `INSTAWP_SFTP_CONCURRENCY` (capped at 8).
- Two-phase design: a single control connection walks the tree and pre-creates directories, then files transfer in parallel. Per-file errors are collected and reported without aborting the whole sync.

## 0.0.1-beta.10 (2026-05-26)

### Fixed — Windows file sync now works
- `instawp sync push/pull`, `local push/pull`, and `local clone` failed on Windows with `rsync: connection unexpectedly closed (0 bytes)` + `sigpacket: Suppressing signal 30 to win32 process`. Root cause: the bundled **msys2 rsync.exe couldn't drive native Windows OpenSSH** (incompatible pipe/signal semantics). The DLL "entry point" fix in beta.6 got rsync.exe to *load*, but the SSH transport still died instantly.
- **Fix**: Windows now transfers files over a **pure-JS SFTP client** (`ssh2-sftp-client`) instead of rsync-over-ssh. macOS/Linux are unchanged (still rsync, with delta sync). New `syncFiles()` dispatcher picks the transport per-platform.

### Changed
- **Removed `rsync.exe` + all msys2 runtime DLLs from the bundle** (~11 MB). The Windows bundle is now just `busybox.exe` (660 KB, statically linked, for the `mysql2sqlite` awk step in `local clone`). Total package shrinks accordingly.
- SFTP transfer honors the same exclude/include patterns as the rsync paths (`.git`, `node_modules`, `cache`, `backup*`, etc.).

### Trade-off
- SFTP does full-file copy (no rsync delta algorithm). Fine for typical wp-content; repeat syncs of large sites are slower than rsync on macOS/Linux. We chose this over bundling an msys ssh (which would have dragged in the ~3.5 MB Heimdal/Kerberos DLL chain).

## 0.0.1-beta.9 (2026-05-23)

### Internals
- CI smoke test now verifies the bundle by extracting the packed tarball directly (via `tar -xzf`) and running `rsync.exe` from the extract dir. Replaces the `npm install -g` step, which was failing on the GHA Windows runner due to Defender quarantine interactions (tamper protection prevented our exclusion settings from taking effect). Real-user installs are not affected — Defender on individual developer machines is configurable and the first reported Windows install showed the bundle landing at the correct path.

## 0.0.1-beta.8 (2026-05-23)

### Bug Fixes (Windows)
- Moved bundled Windows binaries from `bin/win32/` to `vendor/win32/`. With `bin/` and the `bin` field in package.json both set, npm's global install on Windows dropped the `bin/win32/` subdirectory — leaving the CLI unable to find rsync.exe at runtime. macOS/Linux installs were unaffected. Renaming sidesteps the collision entirely.

## 0.0.1-beta.7 (2026-05-23)

### Internals
- Smoke-windows CI job now runs the bundled `rsync.exe` and `busybox.exe` directly from the workspace bundle **before** the npm-install step, so a passing smoke test proves the DLL chain is correct independent of whether antivirus interferes with the global install path.
- Adds Windows Defender exclusions before `npm i -g` to prevent msys DLLs from being quarantined during install.
- Publish job now skips on `workflow_dispatch` (manual triggers), so maintainers can re-test the smoke job without bumping the version.

## 0.0.1-beta.6 (2026-05-23)

### Bug Fixes (Windows)
- Bundled `rsync.exe` now actually loads. beta.4/beta.5 shipped with `msys-2.0.dll` from the legacy `msys2-runtime-3.3` fork, which is missing the `fallocate` symbol that rsync 3.4 needs — produced `Entry Point Not Found: fallocate` on launch and exit code `3221225785` (`STATUS_DLL_INIT_FAILED`) when invoked indirectly via `sync push/pull` or `local clone`.
- Rebuilt the Windows bundle against current MSYS2 packages: `msys2-runtime-3.6.9-1`, `libopenssl-3.6.2-1`, `libiconv-1.19-1`, `libxxhash-0.8.3-1`, `libzstd-1.5.7-1`, `popt-1.19-1`, `libintl-0.22.5-1`. Includes `msys-popt-0.dll` and `msys-intl-8.dll` which the newer rsync now requires.
- Upgraded bundled rsync from 3.4.0 → 3.4.2-2.

### Internals
- `scripts/fetch-windows-binaries.sh` now verifies DLL closure (every referenced `msys-*.dll` is present) and asserts `fallocate` is exported from `msys-2.0.dll` before declaring the bundle valid. Catches "wrong runtime fork" regressions at build time.
- Added `smoke-windows` job to the publish workflow — runs on `windows-latest` and actually executes the bundled `rsync.exe` and `busybox.exe` before npm publish. Publish is now gated on this passing.

## 0.0.1-beta.5 (2026-05-23)

### New Commands
- `db push <site> <file>` — Push a local SQL dump (`.sql` or `.sql.gz`) to the remote MySQL database. Always backs up the remote DB to `~/db-backup-{ISO}.sql.gz` first (skip with `--no-backup`). Confirmation prompt unless `--force`. Closes the #1 gap blocking full-site deploys from the CLI.
- `db pull <site>` — Stream the remote MySQL database to a local gzipped dump. `--output <path>` and `--no-compress` flags.
- `open <site>` — Open the site URL in the default browser. `--admin` opens `/wp-admin`, `--magic` opens the Magic Login URL, `--print` pipes the URL to stdout instead.
- `logs <site>` — Tail logs via SSH. `--wp` (default, debug.log), `--php` (PHP-FPM error log), `--nginx` (nginx error log), `--follow` / `-f`, `--lines <n>`. Multiple flags multi-tail. Probes HestiaCP path variations automatically.
- `sites creds <site>` — Re-fetch WP admin credentials + Magic Login URL for an existing site (previously only available in the `create` output).

### Improvements
- `wp <site>` is now positioned as the primary remote-access command; `exec` is documented as the escape hatch for non-WP shell commands.
- `wp` / `exec` accept POSIX `--` to forward raw args verbatim: `instawp wp my-site -- post list --post_type=page`.
- Spinners are suppressed in non-TTY contexts, CI environments (`CI` env var), `--json` mode, `NO_COLOR`, and `INSTAWP_QUIET` — fixes "Resolving site..." leaking into piped output.

### Bug Fixes
- `instawp wp <site> eval '...'` no longer breaks on parens, quotes, or other shell metacharacters. Each arg is now POSIX shell-quoted before being piped to the remote shell's stdin (previously `args.join(' ')` left metacharacters unescaped, causing remote `bash: syntax error near unexpected token '('`).

### Docs
- New `ROADMAP.md` capturing 15 forward-looking improvement areas (multi-site bulk ops, cost transparency, CI/CD deploy command, shell completion, `doctor`, config file, snapshot/migration CLI, self-update, etc.) ranked by ROI.
- README + CLAUDE.md updated with `wp`-primary positioning and examples for all new commands.

## 0.0.1-beta.4 (2026-05-22)

### Windows — Zero-Install Support
- Bundled `rsync.exe` (with msys2 runtime DLLs) and BusyBox-w64 (`awk` provider) in `bin/win32/`. No more "install Git for Windows / cwRsync" prerequisite — `instawp local clone`, `local push/pull`, and `sync push/pull` work out of the box on Windows.
- Replaced the external `sqlite3` CLI dependency with the `better-sqlite3` Node module.
- New `src/lib/windows-binaries.ts` resolves bundled binaries; falls back to PATH then common Git-for-Windows install dirs.

### Bug Fixes (Windows)
- `instawp local clone` now resolves the bundled `mysql2sqlite` script correctly (was broken by `new URL(import.meta.url).pathname` returning `/C:/...`).
- `mysql2sqlite` is invoked as `awk -f script` explicitly; no longer relies on shebang interpretation.
- `rsync` no longer treats Windows drive paths (`C:\...`) as remote hostnames — paths are converted to msys style (`/c/...`) inside `rsyncViaSsh`.
- `-e ssh -i <key>` argument uses forward slashes + quoted paths so msys/cygwin sh inside rsync parses the key path correctly.
- Eliminated the SQL injection risk in `local clone`'s URL search-replace (now uses bound parameters via better-sqlite3).

### Internals
- New `scripts/fetch-windows-binaries.sh` (maintainer-only) refreshes the Windows bundle from MSYS2 + frippery.org.
- 32 new tests covering path conversion and bundled-binary resolution.
